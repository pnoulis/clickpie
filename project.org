* Clickup
** The clickup API overview
clickup exposes its services through a REST API. One may use CURL to initiate a
one-off request to clickup.

For more complex integrations such as Webhooks, a bi-directional communication
channel is required. Such a channel is made possible only by exposing an API to
clickup through a server. If clickup is configured for bi-directional
communication with a REST API it will initiate a request each time an event
occurs for which a handler has been defined. The server then is responsible for
performing any side effects using clickup's REST API.

* Issues
** DONE Emacs fails to add tabs when indenting rules if the file being parsed in not Makefile (for example, Makefile.in)
CLOSED: [2023-11-28 Tue 21:15]

The .editorconfig file was overriding emacs built-in settings that switch on
indent-tabs-mode by interpreting Makefiles with extensions such as Makefile.in
as normal files converting tabs to spaces.

It was fixed with the following .editorconfig rule:

[Makefile.*]
indent_style = tab
