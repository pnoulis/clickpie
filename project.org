* Using the clickup API
clickup exposes its services through a REST API. One may use CURL to initiate a
one-off request to clickup.

For more complex integrations such as Webhooks, a bi-directional communication
channel is required. Such a channel is made possible only by exposing an API to
clickup through a server. If clickup is configured for bi-directional
communication with a REST API it will initiate a request each time an event
occurs for which a handler has been defined. The server then is responsible for
performing any side effects using clickup's REST API.
